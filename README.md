## 📂 Dataset Overview  
The dataset contains information about Netflix's catalog of movies and TV shows, including:  
- **Show ID**  
- **Category** (Movie/TV Show)  
- **Title**  
- **Director and Cast**  
- **Country of Production**  
- **Release Date**  
- **Rating**  
- **Duration**  
- **Type** (Genre)  
- **Description**

## ✨ Key Features  

### 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning  
- Checked dataset dimensions, column details, and data types.  
- Removed duplicate records and handled missing values using techniques like `dropna()` and heatmaps.  

### 2. Insightful Queries and Analysis  
- **Q1:** Identified the show ID and director for *"House of Cards"*.  
- **Q2:** Determined the year with the highest number of releases and visualized it with a bar graph.  
- **Q3:** Counted and visualized the number of Movies vs. TV Shows.  
- **Q4:** Listed the top 10 directors with the most contributions to Netflix.  
- **Q5:** Filtered records by specific categories, types, and countries (e.g., Movies of type "Comedies" in the UK).  
- **Q6:** Found how many shows or movies feature *Tom Cruise*.  
- **Q7:** Analyzed the unique ratings and their distributions.  
- **Q8:** Checked the highest movie/show duration and the number of TV shows by country.  
- **Q9:** Sorted the dataset by release year.  

### 3. Visualization  
- Used libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create bar graphs, heatmaps, and count plots.  

### 4. Conclusions  
- Summarized key findings, such as:  
  - The year with the highest releases (2019).  
  - Most prolific directors on Netflix.  
  - Unique content types and ratings distribution.
